# NeuroChainX - AI Model Training Marketplace

![](./assets/cover.jpg)

A decentralized marketplace for AI training datasets built with Next.js, Calimero SDK, and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). The platform leverages ICP's robust infrastructure for secure transactions, Calimero for encrypted data storage, and supports over 600 wallets via Coinbase and WalletConnect.

This project was developed for the **[Calimero x ICP Hackathon](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/calimero-x-icp/detail)**, an initiative to push the boundaries of secure, decentralized AI training solutions.
